For streets punctuated by trees, classic brownstones, and an array of independent shops from Beacon's Closet (for vintage clothing) to the Bagel Hole (for breakfast), head to Park Slope. Greenpoint, Brooklyn, is well-known for its pierogis, cozy cocktail dens, and convenient NYC Ferry service. Meanwhile, Redhook, Brooklyn, with its historic cobblestone streets, is home to two distilleries, Van Brunt Stillhouse and Widow Jane — plus, it’s a top destination for seafood, thanks to establishments such as Red Hook Lobster Pound and Brooklyn Crab. Music and sports fans living in the borough can easily catch shows and games at Barclays Center in Downtown Brooklyn. And who needs a Brooklyn gym membership when more than 50 public parks feature fitness equipment? No matter your interest, all can enjoy Manhattan views from the famous pedestrian walkway, Brooklyn Heights Promenade, or on a stroll over the iconic Brooklyn Bridge.</p>\n",
